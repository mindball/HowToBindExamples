# How to sync selection of two data bound ListBoxes

I will show you two ways of syncing the selection of two data bound ListBoxes.

In the first solution, I will create a custom view over the collection and bind both ListBoxes to it. 
Views track the current item of their underlying collection, and allow us to sort, group and filter 
their items. CollectionViewSource is a new class introduced in September CTP that makes it possible 
to create a custom view in markup. Because the custom view created tracks the current item of the 
collection, and currency and selection are in sync in this scenario, binding both ListBoxes to the 
same view causes their selected items to be in sync.

	<Window.Resources>
		<local:GreekGods x:Key="source" />
		<CollectionViewSource Source="{StaticResource source}" x:Key="cvs"/>
	</Window.Resources>
	
	<ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource cvs}}" DisplayMemberPath="Name"/>
	<ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource cvs}}" DisplayMemberPath="Name"/>

I will write about how to use CollectionViewSource to sort, group and filter items in a future post.
An alternative way to achieve the same behavior is to set both ItemsSource properties to the data 
source and set the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem properties to true:

	<ListBox ItemsSource="{StaticResource source}" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" DisplayMemberPath="Name"/>
	<ListBox ItemsSource="{StaticResource source}" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" DisplayMemberPath="Name"/>

This markup works because when binding to a collection, a view is always created. If you don't specify one, 
a default view is created for you internally. Although this view tracks current item the same way the custom 
one did, when you have a default view currency and selection do not sync by default. The way to override 
this behavior is by setting the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem property to true. 

The data team made the default synchronization behavior be different for custom views and default views 
based on customer feedback. This way, users that are aware of the concept of view and are explicit about 
it get the synchronization they expect, and the rest of the users don't.

## Binding a ContentControl (which displays a single item) to a collection of items
```
When binding an ItemsControl to a collection we get the collection; when binding a ContentControl 
to a collection we get the current item of that collection. This is what makes the master-detail 
scenario so simple in WPF.
