# How should I decide whether to use DataContext or Source?
```
 use DataContext only when you need to bind more than one property 
 to a particular source. When binding only one property to a source, 
 I always use Source. The reason for this is ease of debugging - I 
 would rather see all the information about the Binding in one place 
 than search for the nearest DataContext to understand what is going on. 
 In a small sample like the one above there is no big advantage, but 
 in complex applications this could save you some time.
